          </p>
          <p><strong>This is my final attempt at writing.</strong></p>

          <p>I have become subject to this repeating idea that I should write, <em>even if for no one</em>. As usual, rationality did not help. Excuses were made, and I had to start over.</p>

          <p>With the most difficult things, the hardest part is convincing yourself that they're worthwhile. For the first time, I have won such an argument against myself. So if you’re thinking of writing here — maybe for the first time, or perhaps you’re a relapsed writer like me — consider this your sign.</p>

          <p>I suppose thousands of articles are published here every day, so thinking someone will read you is, in a way, arrogance. Why should anyone read you? Ultimately it’s a chance that someone passes through, and a smaller one that you’re paid attention to. <strong>Begin by acknowledging you have nothing better to say than your fellow person</strong>, and that probably no one will ever read you.</p>

          <p>Without an audience, you can begin by writing for no one else. Making things for yourself can be a great thing, but it can also be an excuse. Even if we feel safe and proud of ourselves, escaping the stranger’s eye is a coward’s move.</p>

          <p>Writing only for yourself creates a terribly biased audience of one. All the greatest and worst writers live somewhere in these worlds of one, where the only opinion to measure is your own. <strong>Don’t write for yourself</strong>, and especially, <em>never write for your own opinion</em>.</p>

          <p>Just add these up, and if for no one else, and not yourself, you find none.</p>

          <p>I’ll get back to the subject of my piece: the discouraged writer. Having been there myself, I’ve found him between the first and second paragraphs. He knows no one else will read him, so he won’t write, but he doesn’t know he has to write for someone else to escape writing for himself.</p>

          <p>If he makes the effort, he can escape that trap by writing for no one. To him, I wish the best of luck.</p>
