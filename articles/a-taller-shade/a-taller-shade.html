        <p>Outcomes for second generation immigrants</p>
        <p>Desire to migrate is at <a href="https://news.gallup.com">a record high</a>. Even in Europe, the US and Canada never had so many wanted to leave in the last two decades.</p>
        <p>Among the reasons why, economic opportunity is chief. It is hard to believe that all 900 million intended to migrate will in fact do so. Intentions are only ideation, but it’s on the strength of these that people will leave everything behind. Sure, war and climate change is compelling, but it was employment that dominated the reasons why in <a href="https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu">residency permits in the European Union last year</a>. All over the world, people dream of better economic outcomes for themselves and their children.</p>
        <p>Having to go somewhere else to realise those dreams is often simply necessary.</p>
        <p>But migration is hardly sufficient for prosperity. How can we be sure that the people arriving today will have better lives and incomes? Or that their children will play in a level field with native sons and daughters? Concrete data on economic outcomes for first and second generation migrants is crucial to prove the dreamers right.</p>
        <p>The National Bureau of Economic Research recently released <a href="https://www.nber.org">a working paper on income mobility</a> in 15 destination countries, 11 in Europe, the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. From compiling and harmonising national tax and population data (which in itself is an effort worthy of appreciation) two generations were made the choice. Immigrant parents working in the 1994–2000 period and their children, born between 1978 and 1983 and working in the 2014–2015 tax year.</p>
        <p>Total incomes are taken for parents in the period, although to the pointed fault that immigrants often work informally and out of sight of tax authority. For children, just the one year. Values are ranked accordingly. <strong><a href="graph-ranks.webp">Here’s what we get</a></strong>.</p>
        <p>Mobility outcomes represented by mean rank gaps to native peers, NBER</p>
        <p>Economic outcomes are many things. A job, a car, a house, a pension might be just enough to convince someone that lacks all in their home country. As obvious as it is that the standards of living are better in the US than in Guatemala, it isn’t enough that an immigrant is just better off.</p>
        <p>Economic integration means equal access to comparable opportunities. Migrants for many reasons beyond education and skills disproportionally show up at the bottom quintile of the income distribution. As such, gaps are measured as the rank-point difference in between the means for native and immigrant parents, sons and daughters at the same level in the income distribution. The figure shows in a sense an absolute mobility from these gap differences.</p>
        <p>Overall, the second generation does much better than the first, and daughters significantly outperform sons, nearing or exceeding parity with natives. In countries with lower first-generation inequality—countries with a long history in immigration like the UK, the US and Canada—the children of immigrants actually do better than native children. Still, there are outliers where outcomes are just the opposite—see Spain and Austria.</p>
        <p>The bigger picture is convergence. A second generation of immigrants is effectively more integrated in the labour market and reaching parity with natives at the same level of the income distribution. Acquiring language and a common educational background might be just why.</p>
        <p>Why daughters consistently outperform sons and natives might be attributable to less extreme attitudes towards immigrant-descending women than men, with positive effect in employment discrimination, or less involvement of girls in violence and crime in the troubled neighbourhoods where they stem from.</p>
        <p>On observing mobility, we are tempted to try and predict what the next generation of outcomes will be. Children’s income rank is predicted from their parent’s and various fixed effects. A clever effects decomposition reveals that the between-native and immigrant groups’ effect on income rank is again different for sons and daughters. For the latter, it’s almost irrelevant in comparison to within-group differences in parental income. Searching for fixed effects, we get the usual variables blame game.</p>
        <p>Parental effects other than income yield no explanatory significance, including country of origin. It’s finally revealed to be destination-country conditions like immigration policy and recent openness to immigration (proxied by the share of births from foreign parents), which is something so obvious it should be true. Education, subsidised health and housing, school-to-work institutions and fair labour markets are essential in securing parity for immigrant sons and daughters.</p>
        <p>Migrating is a chance for a better life. From the data, it’s also an act of selflessness. Parents migrate to give their children much better lives, and unlike themselves, a chance at parity with the native born. Integration is again, a story of equality in opportunity. To policymakers, a reminder that great men and women plant trees the shade of which they will never enjoy.</p>
