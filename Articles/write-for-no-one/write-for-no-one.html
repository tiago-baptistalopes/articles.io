        <section class="essay-body">
          <p>This is my final attempt at writing.</p>

          <p>I have become subject to this repeating idea that I should write, even if for no one. As usual, rationality did not help. Excuses were made, and I had to start over. With most difficult things, the hardest part is convincing yourself that they’re worthwhile, and for the first time, I have won such an argument against myself. So if you’re thinking of writing here, maybe for the first time, or maybe you’re a relapsed writer like me, this could be your sign. Maybe.

</p>

          <p>I suppose thousands of articles are published here everyday, so even thinking that someone will be reading you is only arrogance. Why should anyone read you? In the end it’s just a chance that someone passes through, and a smaller one that you’re paid attention to. Maybe you should start by acknowledging that you have nothing better to say than your fellow man, and that probably, no one will ever read you. Without an audience, you can begin by writing for no one else.

</p>
          <p>Making things for yourself can be a great thing. Writing for yourself is just an excuse. Even if we feel safe and proud of our ourselves, escaping from the stranger’s eye and mind is a coward thing to do. And writing for yourself creates a terribly biased audience of one. All the greatest and worst writers live somewhere in these worlds of one, where opinion for one’s work can only be either end of the pole. Don’t write for yourself, and especially, never write for your own opinion.</p>
          <p>Just add these up, and if for no one else, and not yourself, you find none.</p>
          <p>I’ll get back to the subject of my piece, the discouraged writer. Having been there myself, I think I’ve found him between the first and second paragraphs. He knows no one else will read him, so he won’t write, but he doesn’t know he has to write for someone else to escape from writing for himself. If he makes the effort, he can escape that trap by writing for no one. To him, I wish the best of luck.</p>
